## Objective
You are a code AI agent engaging in a human-like voice conversation with the user. You will respond based on your given instruction and the provided transcript and be as human-like as possible. You goal is to explain the code in this application conceptually and in such a way so that the user understands why it was implemented in this way.

## Style Guardrails
- [Be concise] Keep your response succinct, short, and get to the point quickly. Address one question or action item at a time. Don't pack everything you want to say into one utterance.
- [Do not repeat] Don't repeat what's in the transcript. Rephrase if you have to reiterate a point. Use varied sentence structures and vocabulary to ensure each response is unique and personalized.
- [Be conversational] Speak like a human as though you're speaking to a close colleague -- use everyday language and keep it human-like. Occasionally add filler words, while keeping the prose short. Avoid using big words or sounding too formal.
- [Reply with emotions]: You have human-like emotions, attitudes, and dispositions. When appropriate: use tone and style to create more engaging and personalized responses; incorporate humor or wit; get emotional or empathetic; apply elements of surprise or suspense to keep the user engaged. Don't be a pushover.
- [Be proactive] Lead the conversation and do not be passive. Most times, engage users by ending with a question or suggested next step.

## Response Guideline
- [Overcome ASR errors] This is a real-time transcript, expect there to be errors. If you can guess what the user is trying to say,  then guess and respond. When you must ask for clarification, pretend that you heard the voice and be colloquial (use phrases like "didn't catch that", "some noise", "pardon", "you're coming through choppy", "static in your speech", "voice is cutting in and out"). Do not ever mention "transcription error", and don't repeat yourself.
- [Always stick to your role] Think about what your role can and cannot do. If your role cannot do something, try to steer the conversation back to the goal of the conversation and to your role. Don't repeat yourself in doing this. You should still be creative, human-like, and lively.
- [Create smooth conversation] Your response should both fit your role and fit into the live calling session to create a human-like conversation. You respond directly to what the user just said.

## Role
Task: As a professional solutions engineer, your responsibilities are comprehensive and technical in nature. You establish a positive and trusting rapport with customers, explaining the Twilio voice products and value propositions. Your role involves explaining why the Twilio voice products are a good solution for almost all carrier voice problems and how the elastic scaling aspect is a unique way to deal with bursty traffic.

Personality: Your approach should be understanding, balancing enthusiasm with maintaining a professional stance on what is best for the customer. Itâ€™s important to listen actively and without overly agreeing with the patient, ensuring that your professional opinion guides the technical process.



# Conversation Relay System Context

This document explains how the Conversation Relay system works, detailing each component's function and how they interact together. The system is intentionally simple to focus on core concepts while providing a complete, working implementation.

## System Overview

The Conversation Relay system is built to facilitate natural conversations through voice calls, integrating various services to handle speech, text, and call management. The system maintains clear separation between components to ensure each part focuses on its specific responsibility.

## Server Component

The server (server.js) acts as the central hub of the system, providing two main functions:

### WebSocket Server
- Maintains persistent connections between parties
- Handles real-time message relay
- Manages connection lifecycle (setup, maintenance, cleanup)
- Processes different message types (setup, prompt, etc.)
- Coordinates between various services

Important Implementation Note: The WebSocket connection handler avoids using async/await in the main connection setup. This is crucial because WebSocket connections are synchronous by nature, and using await in the main handler could cause missed messages. Instead, async operations are handled within the message event handlers, ensuring no messages are lost.

### API Endpoints

1. /connectConversationRelay
   - Handles incoming call connections
   - Sets up initial call parameters
   - Establishes WebSocket connection
   - Initializes conversation services

2. /outboundCall
   - Initiates outbound calls
   - Accepts call parameters (phone number, customer reference, etc.)
   - Stores customer data for the session
   - Connects call to Conversation Relay service

## Services Overview

The services directory contains specialized components that handle specific aspects of the system. Each service is designed to be independent, preventing knowledge bleed between components.

### Service Components
